        The IEEE Student Branch is one of the most helpful components of the department as it allows students to meet and learn from their classmates as well as faculty and experts in the field. It provides participants with the opportunity to begin networking in their fields of interest and future professions. There are almost 2,000 student branches in over 100 countries worldwide. Student Branch activities give considerable educational, technical, and professional rewards through special projects, events, meetings, participation in regional conferences, workshops, and contests. The Student Professional Awareness Conferences (S-PACs) promote professional awareness, whereas the Student Professional Awareness Venture (S-PAVe) entails building teams to create project proposals to enhance professional awareness and obtaining funds to execute the project.
